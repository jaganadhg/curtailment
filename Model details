Models tested
1- histMeanModel-movingWindow: training data increased with a moving window
*2- histMeanModel: training data 2/3 of all data

3- eigenPCAModel:
*4- eigenPCANormalizedModel: all eigenvectors are normalized

*5- WDmodel: <weighted day model>
		PreDR vector on testday = sum(weights * preDR vectors of training days)
		inDR vector on testday = sum(weights * inDR vectors of training days)

*6- WSmodel: <weighted similarity model>
			find similarity between preDR morning vectors 
			similar vectors get higher weight; weights decrease exponentially
			inDR vector on testday = sum(weights * inDR vectors of training days)

*7 - kNNmodel: all vectors in the training data are clustered into daily 					profiles. Calculate prob of a vector belonging to a cluster as inverse of distance between preDR vector on test day and preDR vectors of cluster centroids. These probs are used as weights.
